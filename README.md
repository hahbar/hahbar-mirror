# Hahbar Mirror

A web app for querying information on the Hedera Hashgraph network using the [public mirror node](https://docs.hedera.com/guides/docs/mirror-node-api/cryptocurrency-api).

Have an idea for a function? Add it for [discussion](https://github.com/hahbar/hahbar-mirror/discussions) and we'll see if it's possible.

## Available functions

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Rank     | Calculate the current rank of an account balance |

## Limitations

The public mirror node is currently throttled so it may take time to calculate a function.
